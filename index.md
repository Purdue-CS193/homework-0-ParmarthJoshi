# Parmarth Joshi's first CS193 Homework

Hi there! This is my page for the homework assignment.

### So, what do I like about CS 193?

```markdown
I like...

- The class structure of CS 193.
- The teaching style of the instructors for CS 193.
- The fact that I'm able to understand everything (hopefully I didn't just jinx myself there).
- Knowing that CS 193 is a good place to get to know others with similar interests as me.
- Being a part of CS 193!
```

### Author's Note:
Thanks for checking out my mini-website! I'm still learning new things, but I'm hoping that I can later create a more sophisticated time as I learn more in this course.
